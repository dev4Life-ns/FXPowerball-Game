# :slot_machine: FX Powerball Game

 ## Description

Powerball game that demonstrates how Java 17's new random number generator API improves the overall process of generating random numbers. The update included several random number implementations, such as:

- Xoroshiro128PlusPlus
- L128X1024MixRandom
- L128X128MixRandom
- L32X64MixRandom
- L32X64MixRandom
- L64X1024MixRandom
- L64X128MixRandom
- L64X128StarStarRandom
- L64X256MixRandom

Since this project does not have specific requirements, we fetch the default generator directly from
the RandomGenerator interface.
